<h3>08 Jun 2021 - Fix this and I might feel like deploying</h3>

<p>After getting the photo page working, I realized the site needed a fresh coat of CSS. A few critical problems need to addressed</p>

<ul>
  <li>Style of articles compared to their titles
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t want to think about what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"># Heading</code> style I’m using in markdown</li>
      <li>The cleanest solution involves changing the titles styles and leaving content to the default styles</li>
      <li>These styles need to be chosen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grid layout used for header and navbar is not behaving the way I want it to
    <ul>
      <li>The basic problem here (as I understand) is that I’ve told the nav bar and header to take up 10% of the page, and when I have a page filled with content its stretching</li>
      <li>I want the header to adjust to the size of the screen, not the amount of content I have</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SCSS has no structure
    <ul>
      <li>Currently as I move between parts of the website I’ve been custom making new CSS</li>
      <li>For both the portability/size of the style-sheet, as well as consistency across the website I need to clean this up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Article/Album lists are not consistent
    <ul>
      <li>The different lists of types of posts (on <a href="/about/">about</a>, <a href="/photos/">photos</a> and <a href="/posts/">posts</a>) are all different, and none are good</li>
      <li>Simplify the design here and make it consistent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Photos should be resized for use in a post
    <ul>
      <li>When this is solved I’ll be able to demonstrate the different issues here, basically I think this can be solved by changing the image property to fit the page</li>
    </ul>

  <img src="/assets/images/2021-06-08-badlayout.png" alt="photo" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixing-the-layout">Fixing the layout</h2>

<p>I started here because presumably this is a quick fix. The pertinent problem involved changing</p>
<pre><code class="language-CSS">grid-template-rows: 5% 5% auto;

</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="language-CSS">grid-template-rows: 5vh 5vh auto;
</code></pre>
<p>to scale with the window size instead of the content size.</p>

<p>I then realized my nav bar was moving depending on the size of the current page.</p>
